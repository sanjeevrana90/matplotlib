This code creates a boxplot that compares the overall ratings of professional football players across three different teams: FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, and New England Revolution. A boxplot is a type of chart used to show the distribution of data, and can be used to compare different groups or datasets.

The code imports the matplotlib library, which is a popular library for creating visualizations in Python. It sets the default style for the plot to ensure that the plot looks clean and professional.

The code then creates a figure with a specific size, using the figsize parameter. This ensures that the plot has enough space to show the data effectively.

The data for the plot is stored in a pandas dataframe called "fifa". The code uses pandas to extract the overall ratings for players in each of the three teams.

The boxplot is created using the boxplot function from matplotlib. The boxplot function takes the data to be plotted, along with optional parameters like labels, patch_artist, color, and linewidth. The patch_artist parameter is set to True to allow the boxes to be filled with color. The color and linewidth of the boxes are set using a for loop that iter
