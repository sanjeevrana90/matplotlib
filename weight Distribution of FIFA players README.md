This code analyzes the weight distribution of FIFA players using a pie chart. The code first imports the necessary libraries, including matplotlib and pandas.

The code then converts the "Weight" column of the FIFA dataset from a string to an integer by stripping the "lbs" suffix from each weight value. This allows us to work with the weight data numerically.

The code sets the plot style to 'ggplot', which is a specific style of plot created by the developers of the ggplot2 library for R. This gives the plot a particular aesthetic look.

Next, the code uses pandas to group the FIFA players into five weight categories: "Under 125", "125-150", "150-175", "175-200", and "Over 200". It counts the number of players in each category and stores the counts in a list called "weights". It also creates a list of labels for the categories and a list called "explode" that specifies how much each category should be separated from the center of the pie chart.

The code then creates the pie chart using the pie function from matplotlib. The pie function takes the weights and labels lists as input, along with optional parameters like autopct (which specifies the format for the percentage labels), pctdistance (which specifies the distance of the percentage labels from the center of the pie chart), and explode (which separates the specified categories from the center of the pie chart) to make space for under 125lbs players.

Finally, the code adds a title to the plot and displays it using plt.show().
